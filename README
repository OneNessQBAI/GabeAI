# DeepSeek AI Terminal (Streamlit App)

This is a Streamlit-based web application that integrates with the DeepSeek API to provide an interactive AI terminal. Users can execute Python scripts, run system commands, perform web searches, and visualize data using the DeepSeek AI model.

---

## **Features**
- **Chat Interface**: Interact with the DeepSeek AI model in a chat-like interface.
- **Code Execution**: Execute Python scripts and system commands directly from the app.
- **Web Search**: Perform web searches using DuckDuckGo.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data using Plotly charts.
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling for API requests and code execution.

---
